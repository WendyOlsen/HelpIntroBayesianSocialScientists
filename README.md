Bayesian statistics for social scientists, a four-part Introduction with Exercises

These four helpful files on Introductory Bayesian social statistics include:
   one Exercises document, <br />
   one 2-page Poster in powerpoint (PDF) at large scale, and  <br />
   a set of 40 Powerpoint slides.  <br />
Use all these for self-managed learning.  Or hold a workshop and learn together! <br /><br />
<br />

In all, this set of materials might take up to three hours to read through at a rapid or superficial level. In the poster, I provide more detail on your learning time inputs for various learning objectives.  For a typical UK based social scientist, it may take 6 weeks at 10 hours a week to learn Bayesian Social Statistics using these methods.  It will take less if your mathematics is very good, or more if you are not familiar with input-output file processing software (such as SPSS, Stata, or R).  I offer an Excel alternative authored by Woodward as a learning objective for those without any programming background... and it really works! - Wendy Olsen <br />
